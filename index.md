## 1st project: E-commerce company project - Linear regression model

### What is the project about?

The data set is about an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing. Customers come in to the store, have sessions meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
